# [Manage Remote Companions](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/698)
A mod for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord to manage remote companions and asult family members.
_____________________
Allows you to manage your companions when they aren't in your party: manage their equipment, allocate perks, and spend their attribute and focus points.
_____________________
If you have the campaign setting enabled to auto-allocate points and perks, then you won't get anything out of this mod. If you want more control though, this will let you manage and optimize your companion's progression.

As of v2.0.0, you can also manage their inventories from afar. This is disabled by default for now, but can be enabled in Mod Options section of the ESC Menu.
As of v2.1.0, this now extends to your spouse and adult children as well.

In light of the new inventory management feature, I've changed the name of this mod from Upgrade Remote Companions to Manage Remote Companions to better reflect the features of the mod.


## Game Versions:
- ☑ e1.4.0 BETA
- ☑ e1.3.0


## Installation:
- Preferably use Vortex, but if you can't, copy the ManageRemoteCompanions folder extracted from the zip archive into Bannerlord's "Modules" directory.
- You may need to unblock the three .dll files (0Harmony.dll, ManageRemoteCompanions.dll and MBOptionScreen.dll) found in this mod's "bin/Win64_Shipping_Client" directory.


## Compatibility:
- **Must be placed above the Community Patch in the load order.**


## Known Issues:
- If you have a save file created in the very early days of Bannerlord's Early Access, some of your companions might not appear when you go to manage their inventories. This is because the game thinks they are still occupied by an event, such as a quest. It's not this mod's job to fix that issue, but if you do encounter this issue, know that I also have a bugged companion and I'm working on it!


## Roadmap:
- Managing troops of remote companion parties. (Maybe garrisons too just because it's almost more work to not include the option.)
